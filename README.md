# Cowrie and Splunk: Honeypot Threat Analysis
<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I run Ubuntu in VirtualBox and deploy a honeypot to capture potential threats. All logs are exported to a SIEM for clear visualization and analysis. To enhance security, I implement multiple techniques to protect both the virtual machine and the host system, following a defense-in-depth approach.

<h2>Project Walk-Through:</h2>


<p align="center">
Before deploying my honey pot, I want to make sure to secure my host machine, first, and then my virtual machine. I start by accessing the built in firewall macOS offers. I turn on stealth mode, to help prevent detection of my host machine.

Stealth scan is now on. keep in my mind, this is does not secure the computer, it only helps keep the machine hidden from pings or port scans.<br />
